 * Queue sets provide a mechanism to allow a task to block (pend) on a read

 *
 * See FreeRTOS/Source/Demo/Common/Minimal/QueueSet.c for an example using this
 * function.
 *
 * A queue set must be explicitly created using a call to xQueueCreateSet()
 * before it can be used.  Once created, standard FreeRTOS queues and semaphores
 * can be added to the set using calls to xQueueAddToSet().
 * xQueueSelectFromSet() is then used to determine which, if any, of the queues
 * or semaphores contained in the set is in a state where a queue read or
 * semaphore take operation would be successful.
 *
 * Note 1:  See the documentation on http://wwwFreeRTOS.org/RTOS-queue-sets.html
 * for reasons why queue sets are very rarely needed in practice as there are 
 * simpler methods of blocking on multiple objects.
 *
 * Note 2:  Blocking on a queue set that contains a mutex will not cause the
 * mutex holder to inherit the priority of the blocked task.
 *
 * Note 3:  An additional 4 bytes of RAM is required for each space in a every
 * queue added to a queue set.  Therefore counting semaphores that have a high
 * maximum count value should not be added to a queue set.
 *
 * Note 4:  A receive (in the case of a queue) or take (in the case of a
 * semaphore) operation must not be performed on a member of a queue set unless
 * a call to xQueueSelectFromSet() has first returned a handle to that set member.
 *
 * @param uxEventQueueLength Queue sets store events that occur on
 * the queues and semaphores contained in the set.  uxEventQueueLength specifies
 * the maximum number of events that can be queued at once.  To be absolutely
 * certain that events are not lost uxEventQueueLength should be set to the
 * total sum of the length of the queues added to the set, where binary
 * semaphores and mutexes have a length of 1, and counting semaphores have a
 * length set by their maximum count value.  Examples:
 *  + If a queue set is to hold a queue of length 5, another queue of length 12,
 *    and a binary semaphore, then uxEventQueueLength should be set to
 *    (5 + 12 + 1), or 18.
 *  + If a queue set is to hold three binary semaphores then uxEventQueueLength
 *    should be set to (1 + 1 + 1 ), or 3.
 *  + If a queue set is to hold a counting semaphore that has a maximum count of
