 * for this hardware.  For hardware independence this should be checked when
 * scheduling updates.  Other hardware dependent details may need to be 
 * considered such as a window time which sets a minimum update time, 
 * and this function should return a recommended delay for clearing.  
 *
 * For the STM32 nominal clock rate is 32 khz, but for the maximum clock rate of
 * 60 khz and a prescaler of 4 yields a clock rate of 15 khz.  The delay that is
 * set in the watchdog assumes the nominal clock rate, but the delay for FreeRTOS
 * to use is 75% of the minimal delay.
 *
 * @returns Maximum recommended delay between updates based on PIOS_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT constant
