/**
 * Input objects: ExampleObject1, ExampleSettings
 * Output object: ExampleObject2
 *
 * This module executes in response to ExampleObject1 updates. When the
 * module is triggered it will update the data of ExampleObject2.
 *
 * No threads are used in this example.
 *
 * UAVObjects are automatically generated by the UAVObjectGenerator from
 * the object definition XML file.
 *
 * Modules have no API, all communication to other modules is done through UAVObjects.
 * However modules may use the API exposed by shared libraries.
