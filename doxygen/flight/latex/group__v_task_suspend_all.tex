Suspends all real time kernel activity while keeping interrupts (including the kernel tick) enabled.

After calling v\-Task\-Suspend\-All () the calling task will continue to execute without risk of being swapped out until a call to x\-Task\-Resume\-All () has been made.

A\-P\-I functions that have the potential to cause a context switch (for example, \hyperlink{_common_2_libraries_2_free_r_t_o_s_2_source_2include_2task_8h_a3033ef5b1abc8618ea205d1082b21bb6}{v\-Task\-Delay\-Until()}, x\-Queue\-Send(), etc.) must not be called while the scheduler is suspended.

Example usage\-: 
\begin{DoxyPre}
 void vTask1( void * pvParameters )
 \{
         for( ;; )
         \{
Task code goes here.\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}...\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}At some point the task wants to perform a long operation during
which it does not want to get swapped out.  It cannot use
taskENTER\_CRITICAL ()/taskEXIT\_CRITICAL () as the length of the
operation may cause interrupts to be missed - including the
ticks.\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}Prevent the real time kernel swapping out the task.
                 vTaskSuspendAll ();\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}Perform the operation here.  There is no need to use critical
sections as we have all the microcontroller processing time.
During this time interrupts will still operate and the kernel
tick count will be maintained.\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}...\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}The operation is complete.  Restart the kernel.
                 xTaskResumeAll ();
         \}
 \}
   \end{DoxyPre}
