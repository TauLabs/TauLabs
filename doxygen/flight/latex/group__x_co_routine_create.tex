Create a new co-\/routine and add it to the list of co-\/routines that are ready to run.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em px\-Co\-Routine\-Code} & Pointer to the co-\/routine function. Co-\/routine functions require special syntax -\/ see the co-\/routine section of the W\-E\-B documentation for more information.\\
\hline
{\em ux\-Priority} & The priority with respect to other co-\/routines at which the co-\/routine will run.\\
\hline
{\em ux\-Index} & Used to distinguish between different co-\/routines that execute the same function. See the example below and the co-\/routine section of the W\-E\-B documentation for further information.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
\begin{DoxyReturn}{Returns}
pd\-P\-A\-S\-S if the co-\/routine was successfully created and added to a ready list, otherwise an error code defined with Proj\-Defs.\-h.
\end{DoxyReturn}
Example usage\-: 
\begin{DoxyPre}
Co-routine to be created.
 void vFlashCoRoutine( xCoRoutineHandle xHandle, unsigned portBASE\_TYPE uxIndex )
 \{
Variables in co-routines must be declared static if they must maintain value across a blocking call.
This may not be necessary for const variables.
 static const char cLedToFlash[ 2 ] = \{ 5, 6 \};
 static const portTickType uxFlashRates[ 2 ] = \{ 200, 400 \};\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}Must start every co-routine with a call to crSTART();
     crSTART( xHandle );\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}     for( ;; )
     \{
This co-routine just delays for a fixed period, then toggles
an LED.  Two co-routines are created using this function, so
the uxIndex parameter is used to tell the co-routine which
LED to flash and how long to delay.  This assumes xQueue has
already been created.
         vParTestToggleLED( cLedToFlash[ uxIndex ] );
         crDELAY( xHandle, uxFlashRates[ uxIndex ] );
     \}\end{DoxyPre}



\begin{DoxyPre}Must end every co-routine with a call to crEND();
     crEND();
