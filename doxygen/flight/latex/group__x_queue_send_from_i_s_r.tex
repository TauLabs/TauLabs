This is a macro that calls \hyperlink{_common_2_libraries_2_free_r_t_o_s_2_source_2include_2queue_8h_a5f3e29eed8f166215648bc6465ebdb04}{x\-Queue\-Generic\-Send\-From\-I\-S\-R()}.

Post an item to the front of a queue. It is safe to use this macro from within an interrupt service routine.

Items are queued by copy not reference so it is preferable to only queue small items, especially when called from an I\-S\-R. In most cases it would be preferable to store a pointer to the item being queued.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em x\-Queue} & The handle to the queue on which the item is to be posted.\\
\hline
{\em pv\-Item\-To\-Queue} & A pointer to the item that is to be placed on the queue. The size of the items the queue will hold was defined when the queue was created, so this many bytes will be copied from pv\-Item\-To\-Queue into the queue storage area.\\
\hline
{\em px\-Higher\-Priority\-Task\-Woken} & x\-Queue\-Send\-To\-Front\-From\-I\-S\-R() will set $\ast$px\-Higher\-Priority\-Task\-Woken to pd\-T\-R\-U\-E if sending to the queue caused a task to unblock, and the unblocked task has a priority higher than the currently running task.
