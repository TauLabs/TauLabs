}
\hyperlink{namespace_eigen}{Eigen} defines several typedef shortcuts for most common matrix and vector types.

The general patterns are the following\-:

{\ttfamily Matrix\-Size\-Type} where {\ttfamily Size} can be {\ttfamily 2},{\ttfamily 3},{\ttfamily 4} for fixed size square matrices or {\ttfamily X} for dynamic size, and where {\ttfamily Type} can be {\ttfamily i} for integer, {\ttfamily f} for float, {\ttfamily d} for double, {\ttfamily cf} for complex float, {\ttfamily cd} for complex double.

For example, {\ttfamily Matrix3d} is a fixed-\/size 3x3 matrix type of doubles, and {\ttfamily Matrix\-Xf} is a dynamic-\/size matrix of floats.

There are also {\ttfamily Vector\-Size\-Type} and {\ttfamily Row\-Vector\-Size\-Type} which are self-\/explanatory. For example, {\ttfamily Vector4cf} is a fixed-\/size vector of 4 complex floats.
