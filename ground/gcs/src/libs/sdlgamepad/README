This is the SDLGamepad library, used to receive gamepad activity from
a SDL supported gamepad.

SDLGamepad is written in C++ with the QT bindings backing it up. It
is was tested on Windows XP, Windows Vista 32/64 bit,
Windows 7 32/64 bit, Mac OSX, Ubuntu 32/64 bit. The SDL Framework is
used to get gamepad input, so you need a working SDL Framework install
on your system! For more information see www.libsdl.org

This program is distributed under GNU LGPL version 3, which can be
found in the file  "COPYING".  This license allows you to use
tank-gamepad freely in commercial programs.
