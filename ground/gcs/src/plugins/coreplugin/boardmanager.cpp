 *   The board manager listens for the arrival or "Board Type" objects, which are
 * instanciated by board plugins. Any plugin that needs to interface with a board
 * at a low level - Serial, USB, etc - can query the Board Manager to understand
 * how to to it. At the moment, the board manager provides information to the RawHID
 * USB library to help it detect boards that are supported. On the roadmap are the
 * following features:
 *    - Provide information on bootloader support - supported or not, what protocol
 *    - Provide information on telemetry protocol to use for that particular board
 *    - Provide board description: textual, icon, board image
 *    - Provide hardware configuration description
 *    - Enable board detection routines over 'generic' links such as serial or network
 *    - Provide board configuration panels to be used by the config plugin
