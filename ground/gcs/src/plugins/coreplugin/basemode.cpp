    \brief A base implementation of the mode interface IMode.

    The BaseMode class can be used directly for most IMode implementations. It has setter functions
    for the mode properties and a convenience constructor.

    The ownership of the widget is given to the BaseMode, so when the BaseMode is destroyed it
    deletes its widget.

    A typical use case is to do the following in the init method of a plugin:
    \code
    bool MyPlugin::init(QString *error_message)
    {
        [...]
        addObject(new Core::BaseMode("mymode",
            "MyPlugin.UniqueModeName",
            icon,
            50, // priority
            new MyWidget));
        [...]
    }
    \endcode
*/

/*!
    \fn BaseMode::BaseMode(QObject *parent)

    Creates a mode with empty name, no icon, lowest priority and no widget. You should use the
    setter functions to give the mode a meaning.

    \a parent
