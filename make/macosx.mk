#   Configure an environment that will allow Taulabs GCS and firmware to be built
#   on a Mac OSX system. The environment will support the current versions of Qt SDK
#   and the ARM toolchain installed to either the Taulabs/tools directory, their 
#   respective default installation locations, or made available on the system path.
