rem To build the OpenPilot software we need few tools in the PATH.
rem Here we attempt to guess tools location searching in the given
rem directories first, and in the PATH last, if not found where expected.
rem
rem Please note that if you have few similar tools installed somewhere but
rem not in the expected location, and they are in the PATH, then the script
rem can detect wrong directories. For instance, if you have QtSDK installed
rem on the D: drive, but have separately installed MinGW toolkit which is
rem in the PATH, then this script detects this MinGW instead of QtSDK's one.
rem As a result, the SDL headers will not be found, if they were copied into
rem QtSDK's MinGW directory. In that case make sure that you have correct
rem directories specified here.
rem
rem Also the SDL should be installed into Qt directories to build the GCS.
rem Check the wiki or ground/openpilotgcs/copydata.pro for details.
rem
rem Also you can add any paths below just by adding extra 'call :which'
rem lines with the following parameters:
rem  - environment variable which will be set to the tool location, if found;
rem  - expected directory for the executable which will be searched first;
rem  - any executable file which will be searched in the given directory
rem    or in the PATH, if not found where expected.
rem All they will be added to the PATH in order of appearance.
