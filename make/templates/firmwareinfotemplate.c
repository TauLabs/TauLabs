 *   4 bytes: GIT commit tag (short version of SHA1).
 *   4 bytes: Unix timestamp of compile time.
 *   2 bytes: target platform. Should follow same rule as BOARD_TYPE and BOARD_REVISION in board define files.
 *  26 bytes: commit tag if it is there, otherwise branch name. '-dirty' may be added if needed. Zero-padded.
 *  20 bytes: SHA1 sum of the firmware.
 *  20 bytes: SHA1 sum of the uavo definitions.
 *  20 bytes: free for now.
